## ES6 Basics

This README.md provides an overview of the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), a major update to the JavaScript language. ES6 introduced several new features and syntax enhancements that make JavaScript more powerful and expressive.

## What ES6 is

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript language. It brings a host of new features and improvements that enhance the readability, maintainability, and functionality of JavaScript code. These changes include arrow functions, template literals, class syntax, and much more.

## New features introduced in ES6

ES6 introduced a multitude of new features, including but not limited to:

- **Arrow Functions**: A concise way to write anonymous functions.
- **Block-scoped Variables**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, enhancing control over variable scope.
- **Template Literals**: A more readable way to create strings with embedded expressions.
- **Default Function Parameters**: The ability to assign default values to function parameters.
- **Rest Parameters**: A mechanism to capture an arbitrary number of function arguments into an array.
- **Spread Operator**: Allows for the expansion of an array or object into individual elements or properties.
- **Class Syntax**: A more structured way to define object constructors and prototypes.
- **Object Destructuring**: A convenient way to extract values from objects into variables.
- **Iterators and for-of Loop**: A new iteration protocol for iterating over collections.

## The Difference between a Constant and a Variable

In ES6, two primary ways of declaring variables are `let` and `const`. The key difference between them is that variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, while those declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. Constants are typically used for values that should remain constant throughout the program's execution.

## Block-Scoped Variables

ES6 introduced block-scoped variables using the `let` and `const` keywords. This means that variables declared with `let` and `const` are limited in scope to the block in which they are defined, providing better control over variable scoping and reducing potential issues related to variable hoisting.

## Arrow Functions and Function Parameters Default to Them

Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions in ES6. They have a shorter syntax and automatically capture the `this` value from the surrounding context. Default function parameters allow you to specify default values for function arguments, making it more convenient to work with optional or missing parameters.

## Rest and Spread Function Parameters

Rest parameters (`...`) allow you to capture an arbitrary number of function arguments into an array, making it easier to work with variable-length argument lists. Spread operators (`...`) allow you to expand arrays or objects into individual elements or properties, making it useful for array manipulation and object cloning.

## String Templating in ES6

Template literals in ES6 provide a more flexible and readable way to create strings that include variable substitutions. You can use template literals with `${}` to embed expressions within strings, making it easier to create dynamic strings.

## Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6

ES6 introduced several enhancements for object creation and manipulation, such as the concise object literal syntax, computed property names, method shorthand, and object destructuring. These features simplify working with objects and make code more expressive.

## Iterators and for-of Loops

ES6 introduced the concept of iterators and the `for-of` loop, which provides a more convenient and uniform way to iterate over data structures like arrays, strings, and custom iterable objects. It simplifies the process of looping through collections and enhances code readability.

This README.md serves as a starting point for understanding the fundamental concepts and features introduced by ES6. Explore each topic further to gain a deeper understanding of how ES6 can improve your JavaScript coding skills.
